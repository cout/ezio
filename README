ezio - A library for doing simple I/O operations (sockets and files) in
C++

Premises:
  - Easy things should be easy
  - Hard things should be easy, but not at the expense of easy things
    being hard
  - Programs should be fast, but not at the expense of legibility
  - Polymorphism is not expensive in an IO-bound application
  - Memory allocations can be expensive and should be avoidable in the
    critical path
